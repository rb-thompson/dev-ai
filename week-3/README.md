# Week 3

*Summary:* Conditional logic within loops allows programs to make decisions during iteration, enabling selective processing, filtering, and control of flow. It's the backbone of intelligent automation, letting your code react dynamically to data as it loops through it.

> "The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity." -Edsger W. Dijkstra

(Dijkstra also contributed heavily to structured programming, where conditional logic plays a central role.)
