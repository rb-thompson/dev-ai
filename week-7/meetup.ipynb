    "But—beep boop—the plants started glitching! Carrots coded themselves into cubes, and the strawberries got stuck in loops.\n",

    "\"Pixel, why not share the soil and let everyone add their favorite crops?\" giggled Bloom.\n",

    "Pixel grinned. \"Turns out, collaboration makes dreams grow bigger!\"\n",
    "\n",

    "Kindness and collaboration turn glitches into giggles—and make gardens (and code) grow stronger.\n",

    "Chapter 1: Pixel’s sleek tech garden with glowing veggies—plants glitching into funny shapes.\n",
